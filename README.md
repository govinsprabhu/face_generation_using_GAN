### Face generation using GAN

This project is developed as part of completing my nano degree from Udacity. It will generate celebrity faces using Generative Adversarial network. Training is done using 200k celeb images from [this](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html) website

Used 5 layers of discriminator and 5 layers of generator. Weights are initialized using Xaviar initialization.
